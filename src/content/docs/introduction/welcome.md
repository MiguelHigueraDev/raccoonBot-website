## First, a few words
raccoonBot is an open-source, multi-purpose Discord bot that's in constant development. It can notify your server members of birthdays, create polls, play trivia with you, and other stuff!

This is a hobby project I'm currently making
for fun, to learn more about TypeScript and back-end development in general.

If you have a suggestion or you want to report a bug, you can do so by
visiting the [GitHub repo!](https://github.com/MiguelHigueraDev/raccoonBot-ts)

**Thanks for using raccoonBot!**
