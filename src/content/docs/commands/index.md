## Notation

### Description

A short description of what the command does.

### Usage

How to use the command, with all the available arguments. 

Arguments are extra options that you add to the command, some of them are required (enclosed in **[[two sets]]** of brackets), and some of them
are optional (enclosed in **[one set]** of brackets).

You can easily switch between arguments by using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key.

### Cooldown

Time required between multiple executions of the same command. If a command is currently in cooldown, its execution will fail.

Bot will send a message notifying you of the cooldown in the future.

### Required Arguments

These arguments **must** be specified for the command to work.

### Optional Arguments

These arguments *can* be specified, but aren't required for the command to work.


### Extra notes

Extra information that's not really required to use the command, but it's nice to know.
