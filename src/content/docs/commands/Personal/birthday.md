### Description
This command lets you save your birthday so people get notified of it.

**All** these conditions must be met for a birthday notification to be sent to a server:

- Your birthday must be set using this command
- The birthday [**/module**](/commands/administration/modules) must be **enabled** in the server
- Your personal [**/preference**](/commands/personal/preferences) must be **enabled** as well for that server

To set your birthday use the command with the **/birthday** command, accompanied by your birthday in yyyy-mm-dd format. **You are able to change your birthday only once a year to prevent spam.**

**Example: February 20th, 1980 would be 1980-02-20.**

If you don't specify a date, your saved birthday will be shown (if it's already saved).

### Usage

`/birthday [birthdate]`


### Optional Arguments

- birthdate: Your birthday in yyyy-mm-dd format
