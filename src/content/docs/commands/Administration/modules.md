## Available Modules

### Birthdays

This module notifies server members of birthdays of people that have saved their birthday using the **/birthday** command and also have enabled their birthday to be shared in this server using their **/preferences** command.

The notifications are sent to the main channel.

**/setting mainchannel**

(or to any available channel in case a main channel isn't set)

### Tags (currently disabled)

This module allows users to save content (text, URLs, images) in a tag using the **/tag** command and then retrieve the tag's contents by using the same command. Due to the user-generated nature of this command it might be better to disable it to prevent NSFW or inappropiate content.
